## Information Technology

As the IT Director at Orthodyne, I played a pivotal role as both the primary IT technician and the lead architect responsible for shaping the company’s technological infrastructure. One of my key achievements was designing and implementing the company’s Microsoft Office 365 tenant and Azure environment, which laid the foundation for our cloud-based operations. During this critical phase of digital transformation, I also took on the challenge of establishing our onsite environment from the ground up. This involved meticulously planning and executing the installation of ethernet routes to all necessary points, as well as designing and constructing a robust onsite server architecture that would support our growing needs.

Beyond the initial setup, I assumed comprehensive oversight of end-user devices through the deployment of Microsoft Intune, ensuring that each device was configured for optimal performance and security. I was also responsible for streamlining the user onboarding process, making it seamless and efficient for new employees to integrate into our systems. Additionally, I provided daily support to end-users, addressing any technical issues they encountered and ensuring that our IT operations ran smoothly. My role required a blend of technical expertise, strategic planning, and hands-on problem-solving, which I applied consistently to drive Orthodyne's IT initiatives forward.
