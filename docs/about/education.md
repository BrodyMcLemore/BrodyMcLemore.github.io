# Education

## Buena Vista University

For my undergraduate studies I attend Buena Vista University. Buena Vista University (BVU) is located in Storm Lake, Iowa. The 4 year private accredited university has been teaching students for over 100 years. 

While attending BVU I studied Analytical Chemistry and Computer Science 

### Chemistry

The BVU chemistry department is chaired by Dr. Lisa Mellmann, who also advised me throughout my undergraduate research and studies. The chemistry program focused on the foundations of science and how it relates and supports chemistry. This includes courses covering general chemistry, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, chemical separations, spectroscopy, thermodynamics, and quantum dynamics.

### Computer Science 

The BVU computer science department is renowned for preparing students to enter the rapidly expanding and ever-evolving field of computer science. The Information Technology concentration course that I studied under focused on teaching skills and knowledge that best prepared students to dive into the IT field immediately after graduation. The course work included dev-ops, database management, web application development, software engineering, cyber security, and network fundamentals.
