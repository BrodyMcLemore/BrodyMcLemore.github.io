# About Me

## Chemistry

For years I have always been fascinated with chemistry as a study of the building blocks of life. Gas Chromatography and R&D both play into my strengths of research and continual improvements. Combing all of these passions has lead me to my current phase in chemistry focusing on R&D, and attempting to better integrate technology with analytical science.

## Information Technology

Ever since my youth I have been fascinated with technology and how it interacts with our daily lives. Continuing to Buena Vista University, I then grew this fascination into a position with the university's IT department. This position allowed me to assist others, solve problems, and teach other how to better integrate technology into their workflows.
