# Undergraduate Internship

During my third year attending Buena Vista University, I was introduced to Analytical Chemistry at Foundation Analytical Laboratory; this internship helped shape my entire professional career.

## Foundation Analytical Laboratory

### Background 

Foundation Analytical was founded in 2008 by Diane Young who still serves as Director of Technical Services to this day. She founded the lab with four key pillars: Integrity, Dedication, Dependability, and professionalism. Through her leadership and guidance, I learned to embody these core principles in my career as well.

### Daily Work

While working at Foundation I served directly under Principle Scientist Dr. Derek Simonsen. Working closely with Derek I learned a majority of my analytical skills and techniques. Specifically, while working with Derek I was introduced to the field of Gas Chromatography and was instantly enthralled. 

On a day-to-day basis I collaborated with other analysts to preform routine analysis on client submitted samples. This routine analysis ranged from micro-toxin analysis on animal feed, to meat bacteria culture studies, to water impurity analysis. These tests required key analytical skills, and meticulous notes and precision.

### Special Projects

#### Cholesterol Analysis  

As the market for animal feed becomes more and more scientific, Foundation's customers began to request the quantification of Cholesterol in their samples. In response, Principle Scientist Dr. Derek Simonsen researched an ATSM approved method of analyzing Cholesterol in animal feed using a GC-FID. However, in alignment with Foundation's core principle of dedication, Diane did not approve the test for customer samples until a internal validation could be preformed to ensure that the analysis method met her standards. 
To pursue this analysis method, Derek assigned the project to me with the goals of: testing the validity of the method, analyzing the cost effectiveness of the method, and conducting small scale market research to prove or disprove the customer interest in the test.

From the assignment, I then spent the next 4 weeks conducting an internal review of the method. This began with testing the method on a external standard for a scientifically significant number of trails. After the trails concluded, I compiled the daily and analyzed it for trends and result reliability. Next, I worked with our internal customer coordinator to gauge customer interest in the test. After understanding customer interest in the test, I ran different economic analysis models to best understand the profitability of offering the test to customers. After all the analysis was complete, I presented this data and my conclusion to laboratory leadership for consideration.  

#### Installation of a UHPLC and the Water Robotic Sampler

The last project that I worked on while at Foundation was to install, validate, and teach the usage of a new Ultra High Purity Liquid Chromatography machine. The UHPLC was a new addition to the lab's current HPLC capabilities, with the new ability to analysis amino acids. I coordinated with the onsite Water technician to install the machine, I then validated the machine to Foundation's standards. Finally, I conducted several internal learning sessions to teach other analysts how to use the new equipment.

The new UHPLC also came with a new Water Robotic Sample handling and conditioning robot. This robotic arm was capable of preparing and conditioning samples for analysis. I installed the machine in conjunction with the new UHPLC for amino acid analysis. Referencing  Water's documentation, I programmed the machine and wrote several pieces of software that prepared customer samples for amino acid analysis. Both the UHPLC and the robotic arm are new analytical and business solutions that allows Foundation to stay on the cutting edge of analytical science.
