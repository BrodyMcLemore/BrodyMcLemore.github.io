## Position Information

- **Company**: Orthodyne Analytical USA
- **Time Period**: February 2024 - August 2024
- **Summary**: I served as the Director of Technology, overseeing the IT, R&D, technical, and final testing departments. I was the gas chromatography and technology subject matter expert for all Orthodyne projects in North America.

## Information Technology

As the IT Director at Orthodyne, I played a pivotal role as both the primary IT technician and the lead architect responsible for shaping the company’s technological infrastructure. One of my key achievements was designing and implementing the company’s Microsoft Office 365 tenant and Azure environment, which laid the foundation for our cloud-based operations. During this critical phase of digital transformation, I also took on the challenge of establishing our onsite environment from the ground up. This involved meticulously planning and executing the installation of ethernet routes to all necessary points, as well as designing and constructing a robust onsite server architecture that would support our growing needs.

Beyond the initial setup, I assumed comprehensive oversight of end-user devices through the deployment of Microsoft Intune, ensuring that each device was configured for optimal performance and security. I was also responsible for streamlining the user onboarding process, making it seamless and efficient for new employees to integrate into our systems. Additionally, I provided daily support to end-users, addressing any technical issues they encountered and ensuring that our IT operations ran smoothly. My role required a blend of technical expertise, strategic planning, and hands-on problem-solving, which I applied consistently to drive Orthodyne's IT initiatives forward.

## Technical (Gas Chromatography)

As the primary technical expert at Orthodyne specializing in Gas Chromatography, I played an integral role across multiple departments, providing invaluable technical guidance and support. My expertise was particularly crucial to the sales department, where I frequently served as a key technical resource. From the early stages of quoting and sales, I worked closely with sales team members to ensure that our offerings met the precise analytical requirements of our customers. This involved not only understanding the intricate details of Gas Chromatography but also effectively communicating these complexities to both the sales team and our clients, ensuring alignment between customer needs and our technological capabilities.

In addition to my contributions to the sales team, I extended my technical expertise to support the final test technicians and service team members. I collaborated with them on troubleshooting complex issues, diagnosing problems with both projects and machines, and guiding them towards effective solutions. My role required a deep understanding of the technical aspects of our products and processes, as well as the ability to apply that knowledge in a practical, hands-on manner. By bridging the gap between technical details and operational needs, I was able to contribute to the success of Orthodyne's projects and the satisfaction of our customers.

## Research and Development

Building on my technical expertise, I took on the leadership role in Orthodyne’s R&D department, where I was responsible for driving the continuous growth and innovation of the company’s analytical offerings. My work began with conducting in-depth market research to gain a comprehensive understanding of our customers’ needs and expectations. This research informed the design and development of cutting-edge systems tailored to meet those specific requirements. By staying attuned to the evolving demands of the market, I was able to ensure that our solutions remained both relevant and competitive.

One of my key achievements in this role was leading the development of several all-in-one systems for various customers. These systems were meticulously engineered to consolidate all necessary measurement functions into a single, integrated package, streamlining operations for our clients and enhancing the overall efficiency of their analytical processes. My approach combined strategic vision with hands-on technical involvement, allowing me to guide projects from concept to completion. Through this work, I contributed significantly to Orthodyne’s reputation for delivering high-quality, innovative solutions that met the precise needs of our customers.
